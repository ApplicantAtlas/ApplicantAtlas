# Event Details

This page lets admins set details of their event such as the time it's taking place and address.

## Making Your Event Public

In order to make your event public, and accessible on the events page you need to check the `Visible` checkbox.

To do this you need to fill out a few of the most basic details about your event: Address, Website, Contact Email.

Then it will be visible on the events page and people will be able to explore the event further when these features are implemented.
