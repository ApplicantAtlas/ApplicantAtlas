# Event Admin Dashboard

This is a guide meant for event organizers to better understand the admin dashboard and its many features and functionalities.

The event dashboard is the main hub for event organizers to manage their events. It's where you can change and configure your event's settings, forms, and more.

We've split the guide into different sections based on the sidebar navigation of the dashboard.

- [Dashboard](./dashboard.md): Shows an overview of your event.
- [Forms](./forms.md): Create and manage forms for your event.
- [Event Details](./event-details.md): Edit your event's details.
- [Pipelines](./pipelines.md): Create and manage event driven pipelines for your event, such as sending emails when a user fills out a form.
- [Email Templates](./email-templates.md): Create and manage email templates for your event.
- [Settings](./settings.md): Configure your event's settings and add additional admins.
