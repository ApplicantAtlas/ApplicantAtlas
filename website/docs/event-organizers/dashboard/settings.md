# Settings

The settings page is where you can configure your event's secrets and add additional admins.

## Event Secrets

Event secrets are used to store sensitive information that you don't want to expose to the public that is used in pipelines. Currently the only secret that is used is the SMTP password for sending emails.

**Note:** When you set a secret it will change the last updated time of the secret, however we don't support viewing the secret after it's been set. So if you hit edit it will be blank, even if data is stored.

## Event Admins

This is where you can add additional admins to your event. Admins have the same permissions as the creator of the event. They can view and edit all the same data as the creator of the event.

To add an admin, simply enter their email address and hit the add button. They must have already signed up for an account on ApplicantAtlas, once done they will be able to view the event in their events.
