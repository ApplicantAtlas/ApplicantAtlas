# Feature Road Map

This is a rough outline of the features we want to implement in the future. This is hopefully a living document. These are more so ideas of what we want to implement in the future, and is not a guarantee that they will be implemented.

The most immediate list of features we want to implement can be found in the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/davidteather/projects/5/views/2), this page should be considered a more long term list of features that would make ApplicantAtlas a more complete platform.

## Planned Features

### Hoster's Admin Panel

We want to create an admin panel and account for the hoster of the ApplicantAtlas instance. This would allow the hoster to see basic analytics of the instance, manage users, and manage the instance.

### Checkin System

We want to implement a checkin system for the event which would allow you to print out a QR code for each participant and allow you to check them into different events by scanning the QR code such as for our hackathon: checkin, lunch 1, dinner, workshops, etc.

### Photo Gallery

We want to implement a photo gallery for the event which would allow you to upload photos and videos of the event and have them displayed on the website. In addition let participants upload their own photos to be approved by event organizers.

### Event Discovery

We should do some more product market fit analysis to see if we should be actually spending time working on this feature, but allowing for event discovery and showing them on a map could be a cool feature.
