# Feature Road Map

This is a rough outline of the features we want to implement in the future. This is hopefully a living document. These are more so ideas of what we want to implement in the future, and is not a guarantee that they will be implemented.

## Planned Features

### Cloud Hosting Service

We want to get to a point where we can host our own instance of ApplicantAtlas for users to use. This would be an optional paid service and would allow users to use ApplicantAtlas without having to host it themselves.

Challenges

- Ideally this would be hosted on lambda function for backend services and this is currently not supported by the current stack.
- Integration with payment services, optional for users to use.

### Hoster's Admin Panel

We want to create an admin panel and account for the hoster of the ApplicantAtlas instance. This would allow the hoster to see basic analytics of the instance, manage users, and manage the instance.

### Checkin System

We want to implement a checkin system for the event which would allow you to print out a QR code for each participant and allow you to check them into different events by scanning the QR code such as for our hackathon: checkin, lunch 1, dinner, workshops, etc.

### Photo Gallery

We want to implement a photo gallery for the event which would allow you to upload photos and videos of the event and have them displayed on the website. In addition let participants upload their own photos to be approved by event organizers.
